# a_visual_and_mathematical_proof_that_neural_nets_can_solve_any_function

A presentation about 'A visual (and mathematical) proof that neural nets can compute any function' for a university seminar on machine learning.

## Presentation

The content is based on the [4<sup>th</sup> chapter](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html) of the e-book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) by Michael Nielsen.

## Webapp

To use the webapp one needs Python 3.x with the package Streamlit and some more.

Run it with:
